# ShortMarch

## Description

This is the official repository for the Advanced Computer Graphics instructed by *Li Yi* at IIIS, Tsinghua University. 

This project contains a simple framework for GPU rendering downgraded from [LongMarch](https://github.com/LazyJazzDev/LongMarch/tree/main) by *Zijian Lyu*.

The demo code is written by *He Li* (TA for 2025 Fall Semester), feel free to contact him if you have any questions.

## How to build

We recommend using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) as the IDE for building this project.

### Step 0: Prerequisites

- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg): The C++ package manager. Clone the vcpkg repo to anywhere you like, we will refer tha vcpkg path as
  `<VCPKG_ROOT>` in the following instructions (the path ends in `vcpkg`, not its parent directory).
- [MSVC with Windows SDK (version 10+)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/): We usually install this via Visual Studio installer. You should select the following workloads during installation:
  - Desktop development with C++

  Then everything should be installed automatically.
- [[optional] Python3](https://python.org): We provide python package with pybind11. Such functionality requires Python3 installation. You may install anywhere you like (System-wide, User-only, Conda, Homebrew, etc.). We will refer the python executable path as `<PYTHON_EXECUTABLE_PATH>` in the following instructions.
- [[optional] Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home): Vulkan is the latest cross-platform graphics API. Since D3D12 is available on Windows, this is optional. Install the SDK [Caution: not the Runtime (RT)] via the official **SDK installer**. You should be able to run `vulkaninfo` command in a new terminal after installation. **No optional components are needed for this project**.
- [[optional] CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads): CUDA is optional, however, some functions such as most of the GPU-accelerated physics simulation features will require CUDA. Install the toolkit with the official **exe (local)** installer. You should be able to run `nvcc --version` command in a new terminal after installation.

- ### Step 1: Clone the repo

- Clone this repo with submodules:
  ```bash
  git clone --recurse-submodules
  ```
  or
- Clone without submodules:
  ```bash
  git clone <this-repo-url>
  ```
  Then initialize and update the submodules (in the root directory of this repo):
  ```bash
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

### Step 2: CMake Configuration

In Visual Studio, open the `Project` -> `CMake Settings for Project` menu, and modify the `CMake toolchain file` to: `<VCPKG_ROOT>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`.

In this process, the CMake script will check whether you have installed Vulkan SDK and CUDA Toolkit, and configure the build options accordingly.

### Step 3: Build and Run

Now you can build and run the project in Visual Studio as usual, selecting the desired target (`ShortMarchDemo.exe` for the demo we provided).

## Bug Shooting

### CMake Configuration Issues

Make sure that you have set the `CMake toolchain file` correctly to `<VCPKG_ROOT>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`. After any change to the configuration, remember to clean the CMake cache (via `Project` -> `CMake Cache` -> `Delete Cache and Reconfigure` menu in Visual Studio) and reconfigure the project.

### Vulkan Validation Layer Error

If you encounter the following error when running the application:
```
validation layer (ERROR): loader_get_json: Failed to open JSON file </path/to/a/json>
```
where `/path/to/a/json` is a non-existent file, it indicates that the Vulkan validation layers are trying to load a configuration file that does not exist on your system. Hopefully, the </path/to/a/json> is related to your Steam or Epic Games installation. To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:
1. Press `Win + R` and type `regedit` to open the Registry Editor.
2. Try to find the `</path/to/a/json>` under:
	- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\ImplicitLayers`
	- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\ExplicitLayers`
	- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\ImplicitLayers`
	- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\ExplicitLayers`.
3. Delete the entry that points to the non-existent JSON file and restart your program.

## Getting Started with the Ray Tracing Demo

The `src/` directory contains a minimalistic interactive ray tracing demo that showcases hardware-accelerated ray tracing using the LongMarch framework. This demo features a scene-based architecture with entity management, interactive camera controls, and an ImGui-based inspection interface.

In your own project, you could either start from this demo or build from scratch. You could modify any file in the `src/` directory to fit your needs.

### Project Structure

```
src/
├── main.cpp              # Application entry point
├── app.h/app.cpp         # Main application class with rendering loop
├── Scene.h/Scene.cpp     # Scene manager (TLAS, materials buffer)
├── Entity.h/Entity.cpp   # Entity class (mesh, BLAS, transform)
├── Material.h            # Material structure for PBR properties
└── shaders/
    └── shader.hlsl       # Ray tracing shaders (raygen, miss, closest hit)
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Scene-Based Architecture
- **Scene Management**: The `Scene` class manages multiple entities and builds the Top-Level Acceleration Structure (TLAS)
- **Entity System**: Each `Entity` contains a mesh (loaded from `.obj` files), a material, and a transform matrix
- **Materials**: Simple PBR materials with base color, roughness, and metallic properties

#### 2. Interactive Camera Controls
The demo supports two modes:
- **Camera Mode** (right-click to enable):
  - `W/A/S/D` - Move forward/left/backward/right
  - `Space/Shift` - Move up/down
  - Mouse - Look around (cursor hidden)
  
- **Inspection Mode** (right-click to disable camera):
  - Mouse - Hover over entities to highlight them
  - Left-click - Select entity for detailed inspection
  - UI panels display camera, scene, and entity information

#### 3. Entity Highlighting and Selection
- **Hover Highlighting**: Entities glow yellow when the cursor hovers over them
- **Click Selection**: Left-click on an entity to select it and view details in the right panel
- **Ray-Sphere Intersection**: CPU-side ray casting matches GPU rendering for accurate picking

#### 4. ImGui Interface
Two non-collapsible panels appear in inspection mode:
- **Left Panel** (Scene Information):
  - Camera position, direction, yaw, pitch
  - Speed and sensitivity settings
  - Entity count, material count, total triangles
  - Hovered and selected entity IDs
  - Render information (resolution, backend, device)
  - Controls hint
  
- **Right Panel** (Entity Inspector):
  - Dropdown to select any entity
  - Transform information (position, scale)
  - Material properties (base color, roughness, metallic)
  - Mesh statistics (triangles, vertices, indices)
  - BLAS build status

### How to Use

1. **Build and Run**:
   ```bash
   # In Visual Studio, select target: ShortMarchDemo.exe
   # Press F5 to build and run
   ```

2. **Navigate the Scene**:
   - Start in inspection mode (cursor visible)
   - Right-click to enable camera mode and fly around
   - Right-click again to return to inspection mode

3. **Inspect Entities**:
   - Move cursor over objects to see them highlight in yellow
   - Left-click to select an entity
   - View detailed information in the right panel
   - Or use the dropdown menu to select entities manually

### Code Architecture

#### Application Class (`app.h/app.cpp`)
The main application class manages:
- Graphics core initialization (D3D12 or Vulkan)
- Window creation and event handling
- Camera state and controls
- Scene rendering and entity interaction
- ImGui interface rendering

Key methods:
- `OnInit()` - Initialize graphics, create scene, load entities
- `OnUpdate()` - Process input, update hover detection, upload GPU buffers
- `OnRender()` - Execute ray tracing, render ImGui overlays
- `OnClose()` - Clean up resources
- `UpdateHoveredEntity()` - CPU-side ray casting for entity picking

#### Scene Class (`Scene.h/Scene.cpp`)
Manages the scene graph:
- `AddEntity()` - Add entities to the scene
- `BuildAccelerationStructures()` - Build TLAS from all entity BLAS
- `UpdateMaterialsBuffer()` - Upload materials to GPU
- `GetTLAS()` - Get the acceleration structure for rendering

#### Entity Class (`Entity.h/Entity.cpp`)
Represents individual objects:
- `LoadMesh()` - Load geometry from `.obj` files
- `BuildBLAS()` - Create Bottom-Level Acceleration Structure
- Material and transform properties

#### Shader (`shaders/shader.hlsl`)
HLSL ray tracing shaders:
- `RayGenMain` - Generate primary rays from camera
- `MissMain` - Sky gradient for missed rays
- `ClosestHitMain` - Shading with material properties and hover highlighting

### Adding New Entities

To add new objects to the scene, edit `Application::OnInit()` in `app.cpp`:

```cpp
// Example: Add a new red sphere
auto red_sphere = std::make_shared<Entity>(
    "meshes/preview_sphere.obj",                    // Mesh path
    Material(glm::vec3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), 0.3f, 0.0f),  // Red, smooth, non-metallic
    glm::translate(glm::mat4(1.0f), glm::vec3(3.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f))  // Position
);
scene_->AddEntity(red_sphere);
```

After adding entities, remember to call `scene_->BuildAccelerationStructures()`.

### Customizing Materials

Materials use a simple PBR model:
```cpp
Material(
    glm::vec3(r, g, b),  // Base color (0.0 to 1.0)
    roughness,            // Surface roughness (0.0 = smooth, 1.0 = rough)
    metallic              // Metallic factor (0.0 = dielectric, 1.0 = metal)
);
```

### Technical Details

- **Acceleration Structures**: Uses hardware ray tracing with BLAS per entity and a single TLAS
- **Resource Bindings**:
  - Space 0: Acceleration Structure (TLAS)
  - Space 1: Output image (UAV)
  - Space 2: Camera info (constant buffer)
  - Space 3: Materials (structured buffer)
  - Space 4: Hover info (constant buffer)
- **Ray-Sphere Intersection**: Approximate bounding sphere per entity for fast CPU picking
- **Coordinate Systems**: Matches GPU ray generation for pixel-perfect hover detection

### Known Limitations

- **Approximate Hover Detection**: Uses bounding spheres instead of precise mesh intersection
- **Simple Lighting**: Placeholder normal (up vector) for diffuse shading
- **Static Scenes**: Animation requires manual `UpdateInstances()` calls
- **Single Window**: ImGui context supports only one window at a time
